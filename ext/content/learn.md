We are currently developing a series of tutorials to make it easy to learn how
to use each of the modules in Rapture. Currently, there is only one tutorial
available, giving a broad overview of a few of the different modules available:

- [Getting Started with Rapture](/intro)

### Upcoming Tutorials

Below is a short and incomplete list of ideas for future tutorials, which we
hope to appear soon:

- Extracting static types from JSON
- Exploiting the type system to writing correct HTML
- Making internationalized messages typesafe
