The API documentation for Rapture will be an important part of this website,
and providing comprehensive coverage of each of the modules in Rapture,
presented in a convenient and navigable format, will be the focus of much of
the work on the Rapture project over the first few weeks of 2016.

For now, we have none. But the intention is to introduce API documentation
to support code in the Rapture blog articles, as they are written, and to
evolve a comprehensive, but usable, interface to that reference documentation
as it grows.
